          Description
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I first discovered this dish in the most unexpected place: an airport in <strong><em>Thailand</em></strong>.
      <br>
      I was tired, in-between flights, and not expecting anything more than the usual bland terminal food.
      <br>
      But then I spotted a small stall selling something wrapped in <strong><em>banana leaves</em></strong>; warm, fragrant, and slightly sweet-smelling.
   </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Sticky mango rice</em></strong> is a sweet, creamy Thai dessert made with glutinous rice, ripe mango, and rich coconut milk.
      <br>
      Traditionally served warm in banana leaves, it's a tropical treat full of flavor and comfort.

    <h3>
      <strong>
        Ingredients
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 cup glutinous (sticky) rice
      </li>
      <li>
        1 ½ cups coconut milk
      </li>
      <li>
        ¼ cup sugar
      </li>
      <li>
        ½ tsp salt
      </li>
      <li>
        1 or 2 ripe mangoes, peeled and sliced
      </li>
      <li>
        Banana leaves (optional, for wrapping and presentation)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sesame seeds or mung beans (optional, for garnish)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <strong>
          Instructions
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <em>
            Soak the rice
          </em>
        </strong>
        <br>
        Rinse the sticky rice several times until the water runs clear.
        <br>
        Soak in water for at least 4 hours or overnight.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <em>
            Cook the rice
          </em>
        </strong>
        <br>
        Drain the soaked rice and steam it for 20–30 minutes until tender.
        <br>
        (Use a steamer lined with cheesecloth or a bamboo basket if possible.)
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <em>
            Make the coconut sauce
          </em>
        </strong>
        <br>
        In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, sugar, and salt.
        <br>
        Heat gently until the sugar dissolves; don’t let it boil!
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <em>
            Combine rice and sauce
          </em>
        </strong>
        <br>
        Once the rice is cooked, transfer it to a bowl and slowly mix in about 1 cup of the warm coconut sauce.
        <br>
        Let it sit for 10–15 minutes so the rice absorbs the flavor.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>
          <em>
            Serve
          </em>
        </strong>
        <br>
        Shape the sticky rice into small portions (or roll into sticks if using banana leaves),
        <br>
        top with mango slices, and drizzle with remaining coconut sauce.
        <br>
         Garnish if desired.
      </li>
