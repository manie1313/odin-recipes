# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipe website built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It includes a main index.html page that links to a few individual recipe pages.

The goal of this project is to practice writing and structuring HTML. The focus is on building a solid foundation, so the site is kept simple and unstyled for now. Weâ€™ll revisit it later to improve the design using CSS.
